# company-team-generator

A program that generates a layout of the company team


I built this project to be able to create a company team generator to create a html web application that displays the selected team for that company.

This application will make company's more organized when it comes to displaying they're team and also have the ability to add more or remove more team members.

I learned how to use node.js to ask the user for information and then take that information and display it on a webpage as well as creating classes, subclasses and tests.




## Installation


in order to run this program you will need to install node.js, inquirer, and also fs.
